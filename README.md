# CollegeScorecard_Project

Given the importance of future earnings as a factor in college selection and as an indicator of college quality, it is important to understand what institutional and student characteristics are important in determining students’ future earnings.

Using the College Scorecard data (U.S. Department of Education, 2021), **this project aimed to determine the institutional and student characteristics that are the most important predictors of students’ future earnings being in the top 25% across all colleges**. For this purpose, the parametric technique used was **Logistic LASSO Regression**, while the non-parametric technique used was a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The analysis was conducted for both private and public educational institutions collectively, as well as separately for only private non-profit educational institutions. Average faculty salary and median household income were two of the most important predictors across all models. Factors under the control of educational institutions can essentially be modified in order to increase the probability of their students' earnings being in the top 25%. However, ethical and even legal concerns need to be kept in mind while doing so.
